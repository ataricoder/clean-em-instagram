## Libraries/Dependencies
Clean 'Em Bot for Instagram uses [Instapy](https://www.google.com "Instapy Repo") as the backend library that drives the Instagram Bot.

Python3 is recommended inside a python environment via pyenv but is not required. (Python 2.7+)

The main program is called **'massive_****follow****_****then****_****unfollow****_****works-non-stop.py'**

And you can run it by typing `sudo python3 massive_follow_then_unfollow_works-non-stop.py`in a Unix terminal.

The `sudo` may or may not be necessary if you have administrative privileges, but to err on the safe side  include it.
